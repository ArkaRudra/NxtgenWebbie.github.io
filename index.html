                Gaṇarājya),[23] is a country in South Asia. It is the second-most populous country, the seventh-largest
                country by land area, and the most populous democracy in the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the
                south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders
                with Pakistan to the west;[f] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the
                east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and
                Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small1">No skill is more valuable and harder to come by than the ability to
                critically think through problems. Schools don’t teach you a method of thinking. Thinking is one of
                those things that can be learned but can’t be taught.When it comes to thinking the mind has an optimal
                way to be operated. When operated correctly you’ll
                find yourself with plenty of free time. When operated incorrectly, most of your time will be consumed
                correcting mistakes.Good decisions create time, bad ones consume it. Good initial decisions pay
                dividends for years,
                allowing abundant free time and low stress. Poor decisions, on the other hand, consume time, increase
                anxiety, and drain us of energy.

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Researches made on Psychology</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Let’s start with how you don’t learn to think. A study by a team of
                researchers at Stanford came out a couple of months ago. The investigators wanted to figure out how
                today’s college students were able to multitask so much more effectively than adults. How do they manage
                to do it, the researchers asked? The answer, they discovered—and this is by no means what they
                expected—is that they don’t. The enhanced cognitive abilities the investigators expected to find, the
                mental faculties that enable people to multitask effectively, were simply not there. In other words,
                people do not multitask effectively. And here’s the really surprising finding: the more people
                multitask, the worse they are, not just at other mental abilities, but at multitasking itself.
